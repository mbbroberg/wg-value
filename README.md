# CHAOSS Value Metrics Group (VMG)

The VMG focuses on metrics that directly result in funding community activities.

We are interested in aggregating approaches to valuing community activities that successful results in funding. This groups welcomes any metric that is one step removed from funding community programs, whether it's in the shape of an Open Source Program Office (OSPO), Developer Relations (DevRel), or influencer program (ex. Microsoft MVP).

## How to get involved

All contributors are welcome to participate in VMG. Regular participants have the opportunity to join as a [Core Contributor](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value#core-contributor). Here are the ways to do so.

The VMG is working under the umbrella of the [CHAOSS project](https://chaoss.community/) as part of the [Linux Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/). 

We welcome everyone to join us by: 

* Joining the general [CHAOSS mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/chaoss)

## Background

Community initiatives do not reflect the same direct monetary value as other common organizational efforts.

### Known limitations

The approach used to date (March 2020) uses language that defaults to the technology industry and its organizational structures. These terms may not reflect other industries or organizations (e.g. nonprofits). Please bring up terminology discrepencies or recommendations through [a new issue](https://github.com/chaoss/wg-value/issues).

### Goal

Between March 2019 and September 2019 we will execute a launch plan with
limited goals:

Identify Stakeholders and Validate Interest
- Identify market segments and stakeholders
- Understand Who cares about Open Source Value (and why)
- Specify and prioritize Key Performance Indicators
- Calculate potential aggregate economic value

Grow hands-on community
- CHAOSS Members: Consultants, researchers, grant writers
- Project Stakeholders: Sponsors, maintainers, contributors, consumers

Build reusable assets
- Repeatable methodology for discovering value
- MVP Tooling with Development Roadmap

In the long term, we’d like to publish trusted industry-standard Value Metrics.
A kind of S&P for software development, an authoritative source for metrics
significance and industry norms.  

## Focus Areas

| Focus Area | Goal |
| --- | --- |
| 1. [Labor Investment](./focus-areas/labor-investment) | Estimating the labor investment in open source projects. |
| 2. Innovation Value | Evaluating open source project development for comparing with in-house and outsourcing options. |
| 3. Downstream Value | Estimate the value provided to other open source projects. |
| 4. [Ecosystem Value](./focus-areas/ecosystem) | Estimating the value of an open source project’s ecosystem. |
| 5. [Living Wage](./focus-areas/living-wage) | Expanding opportunities for people to make a living wage in open source. |
